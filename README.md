## Team 12828 (Critical Overload) Relic Recovery
This is Team 12828's , Critical Overload, code used for the 2018-2019 Rover Ruckus Game Season

## Who are we?
We are Team 12828, Critical Overload, or CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) for short. We are a group of 14-17 year olds who meet in Morrisville, NC that enjoy being together and building robots. Making jokes, sarcastically commenting each other's work, eating pizza and other snacks, and being awkard are what we enjoy about our team.

This is our second year as a FTC team and we have a lot to learn. Before this adventure we were known as Team 4495, The Awesome Bots, who made it to The Razorback Invitational on our final year of an FLL team. We are proud of what we have accomplished but know that we have so much more to learn.
